# --------------------------------------Why did I make it--------------------------------------

# This program is Slow file manger
# Remeber sometimes when you downloads images system automaticle download it into 'Downlaods' but you have seprate folders like one for
# for you application web but onther path for your wallpapers or anothr one for your familiy

# --------------------------------------How it work--------------------------------------

# rhis just example and will change I will change how the program will work

# This program choose what files to orginize and what to ignore depending on the fiel name
# exampel: Documentationyafo-my_project.txt
# 'Documentaion' is the destination
# 'yafo' is the trigger
# '-' is for syntax and is not nececrey
# 'my_project' is the file name
# '.txt' is the extension
#
# '' is the destination(is the path where your file is going to go)
# 'yafo' end it with yafo and you may add "-" after yafo for syntax the program automatically will
# delet it

# --------------------------------------What argument you could add--------------------------------------
