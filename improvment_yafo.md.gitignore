# Improvements for yafo.py

This file summarizes the suggestions for improving the `yafo.py` script.

### 1. Fix the Main Execution Logic

The `machine()` function is never called. The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block should be updated to run the main file organization logic.

**Suggested Code:**
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    print("Scanning directories...")
    make_map()
    print("Organizing files...")
    machine()
    print("Done.")
```

### 2. Improve Performance with a Dictionary

Searching for the destination folder by looping through a list is inefficient. Using a dictionary (hash map) for lookups will be much faster.

**Suggested Code:**
```python
# Create a dictionary to map folder names to their paths
folder_map = {}
for path, subfolder, file in os.walk(start):
    folder_map[os.path.basename(path)] = path

# In the move logic, use the dictionary for a fast lookup
destination_name = pfile[:pfile.index('yafo')]
if destination_name in folder_map:
    destination_path = folder_map[destination_name]
    # ... move the file
```

### 3. Correct and Simplify Logic

The type-checking logic is incorrect and can be simplified. A function named `is...` should ideally return a boolean, not perform actions. The logic should be refactored for clarity.

### 4. Avoid Global Variables

Relying on global variables makes the code harder to understand and maintain. It's better to pass data (like the folder map) as arguments to functions.
